The lattice constant of Argon is 5.25 Angstroms. To do this, we will create an ASE `atoms` object using the `FaceCenteredCubic` method that is part of the `ase.latticle.cubic`. The created `atoms` object contains information about the type and number of atoms in your system, the positions of every atom, system dimensions, etc. We will use the ASE `units` method to add the right units to our quantities to avoid problems later on."

    "Now that we have a starting structure for our system, how are the particles going to interact with each other? One commonly used interatomic potential is known as the Lennard-Jones or 12-6 potential. This potential is named after Sir John Edward Lennard Jones who studied the attractive forces, also known as van der Waals or London dispersion forces, in noble gases. The Lennard-Jones potential is composed of an attractive component that decays proportionally to $1/r^6$, where $r$ is the distance between particles, and a repulsive term that rapidly grows proportionally to $1/r^{12}$ to keep particles from getting too close to each other (i.e., from Pauli repulsion forces). The $1/r^6$ attractive term is obtained analitically by quantifying the forces due to the spontaneous fluctuations in the electron clouds of atoms, while the $1/r^{12}$ relationship is chosen ad-hoc for numerical efficiency reasons as one can compute it as the square of the attractive term, $1/r^{12}=1/(r^6)^2$. The full potential is written as\n",

ASE `calculators` may execute internal built-in methods or external programs that can simulate systems using a variety of classical or *ab initio* methods. We will import the `LennardJones` calculator and add it to our `atoms` object. We also need to tell our calculator the specific values of the potential for Ar including $\\sigma=3.4~\\unicode[serif]{xC5}$, $\\epsilon=0.9889744$ kJ/mol, and the cutoff radius, $r_c=15~\\unicode[serif]{xC5}$. The cutoff radius is used to speed-up calculations by limiting the number of neighbors that particles interact with.
