    "The temperature and pressure in a simulation can be controlled by algorithms known as **thermostats** and **barostats**. A thermostat acts like a 'heat bath' that controls the temperature so that it remains near a desired value. A simple example of a thermostating algorithm is known as the **isokinetic or Gaussian thermostat**, which is broken into 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the future velocities ($v(t+\\Delta t$) using an algorithm such as Verlet or velocity-Verlet\n",
    "- Compute the the temperature of the future timestep, $T(t+\\Delta t)$\n",

    "- Remove the center of mass velocity in order to prevent drifting of the system in space (the flying ice cube problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the isokinetic thermostat is effective in keeping the temperature fixed at some reference value, it can lead to numerous problems including abrupt changes in the velocities and improper sampling of the energy. Sampling of the energy is very important as statistical mechanics indicates that a system that is under a constant temperature, constant number of particles, and constant volume ($NVT$, also known as the canonical ensemble) must have certain properties. For a system in the canonical ensemble, the energy will not be constant but it will fluctuate around and equilibrium value $\\langle E \\rangle$. The fluctuations in the energy, $\\langle E^2 \\rangle$, are also determined by the canonical ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most thermostats don't try fix the temperature so that the instantaneous value is constant at every time step, but instead gently adjust the kinetic energy at given intervals so that the average temperature, $\\langle T \\rangle$, oscillates near a desired value with some characteristic oscillation time, $\\tau_T$. A complete discussion on various thermostating techiques is beyond the scope our class. A widely used thermostat that fulfills all our desired qualities (correct average energy and fluctuations as well as fast relaxation to the correct temperature) is the **stochastic velocity-rescaling** algorithm by Bussi, Donadio, and Parrinello (J. Chem. Phys. 126, 2007, 014101. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2408420)\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogous to a thermostat, a barostat maintains the average pressure of system constant by effectively coupling the simulation cell to a 'piston' that changes the size accordingly. When running an MD simulation under constant number of particles, constant pressure, and constant temperature, it is said to be in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble ($NPT$). Most barostats don't try fix the pressure so that the instantaneous value is constant at every time step, but instead gently adjust the simulation cell dimensions (and sometimes the positions/veloities) at given intervals so that the average pressure, $\\langle P \\rangle$ oscillates near a desired value with some characteristic oscillation time, $\\tau_P$. Similarly to the canonical ensemble, a system in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble will have a volume that oscillates around an equilibrium value, $\\langle V \\rangle$, and will have certain volume fluctuations, $\\langle V^2 \\rangle$. A recently developed barostat that fulfills all our desired qualities (correct average volume and fluctuations as well as fast relaxation to the correct pressure) is **the stochastic cell-rescaling** algorithm by Bernetti and Bussi (J.
