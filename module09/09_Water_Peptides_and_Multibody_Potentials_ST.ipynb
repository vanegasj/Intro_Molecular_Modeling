    "\n",
    "Simulation of complex macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, etc. requires definition of multi-body potentials that can constrain the geometry of these molecules to match known experimental quantities. An excellent description of commonly used bonded-potentials is given here https://computecanada.github.io/molmodsim-md-theory-lesson-novice/01-Force_Fields_and_Interactions/index.html#bonded-terms . In addition to these multi-body potentials and Lennard-Jones non-bonded interactions, most biomolecules of interest are polar and therefore we must also consider charged interactions (i.e., coulomb forces). These coulombic forces cannot treated with a simple cut-off as we do with the Lennard-Jones forces, but must be computed using various reciprocal-space methods such as particle-mech Ewald (PME): https://computecanada.github.io/molmodsim-md-theory-lesson-novice/06-electrostatics/index.html and https://courses.physics.illinois.edu/phys466/sp2013/projects/2002/team1/Ewald3.htm .\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the parameters for our molecule of interest, we must also pay close attention to the treatment of water as it is an ubiquitous component and an essential driving force of molecular interactions. There are a large number of water models with various levels of complexity that have been developed over the years. A nice summary is provided here: https://computecanada.github.io/molmodsim-md-theory-lesson-novice/09-water_models/index.html .\n",

    "A combination of consistent parameters used to simulate a general class of molecules such as proteins is called a **force-field**. Force-fields are usually developed for a particular application based on experimental structural data (e.g., X-ray crystallography, NMR, spectroscopy, etc.), thermodynamic properties (e.g., density, heat of vaporization, surface tension, free energy of solvation, etc.), and quantum mechanical data (e.g., Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory calculations).
