    "Make a plot of the resulting data in the `nve_total_energy.xvg` file using matplotlib. Note that by default GROMACS adds some header lines at the top of the file that start with **@** characters, which are useful when creating plots with the program Xmgrace (https://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/), but which will cause problems when loading into numpy. You can use the `numpy.loadtxt` to load the data into a numpy array by specifying that both `#` and `@` characters should be treated as comments:\n",
