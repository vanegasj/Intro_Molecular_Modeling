Modify this function so that it takes as an additional input another function `F` which computes the force acting on the spring. This will allow us to generalize the Verlet algorithm to use any force, not just the harmonic spring. This means that the input for your Verlet function is now `Verlet(x0, k, m, F, tmax, dt)`. Inside your Verlet function, you must pass the value of $x$ to your function `F` at a every iteration: `F(x[n],k)`. This is because the force depends on the value of $x$ at every iteration.\n",
